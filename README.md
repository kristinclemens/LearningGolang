# Learning Golang

## Why this repository?

As a professional software engineer, I find I don't learn well by following along with beginner and even intermediate
language tutorials. Most are either too simplistic for me, or "on rails" in ways that don't work well with the way
that my brain makes connections. I want to learn more about specific features and end up diving headfirst into rabbit
holes. By the time I surface and return to where I was in the tutorial, my understanding is far ahead of where the
tutorial is expecting me to be at that point, and I rapidly lose interest.

As I began learning Golang, I encountered this pattern once more. Instead, I searched for "Golang projects for Java
developers," and came across useful, straight-to-the-point articles discussing important differences between Java and Go.
So far, this has turned out to be a much better option for me, allowing me to take each feature of the language and
explore it as much as I want before returning to the next. While doing so, I learn about and use features that are
common to most languages -- such as packages, I/O, string formatting, print statements, etc. -- in a way that is fluid
rather than prescribed.

This repository represents my exploration of Golang beginning from that point, shared in a fashion that is hopefully
useful for other developers.
